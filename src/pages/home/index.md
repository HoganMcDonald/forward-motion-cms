  title: What Therapy Looks Like
  content: |-
    I believe life is about who you are in relationship, whether that relationship is with yourself, a partner, co-worker, boss, friend, pet… whoever. How you react, how you communicate, what level of awareness you have of yourself; your reactions, triggers, attachments, communication styles, etc. - they all matter! And… they all directly affect every single one of our relationships.

    Unfortunately, we’re not explicitly taught & socialized how to exist, grow, or thrive in relationships. Therapy is an ideal place to learn, grow, and create the space in your life and relationships that can foster forward motion from patterns you’re cycling in.

    I received my MA in Marriage and Family Therapy from St. Mary’s University of MN, and my BS in Community Psychology from St Cloud State University.

    I am working toward Licensure and all therapeutic services I provide are under the supervision of Shawn R Neel, MS, LMFT with The Institute for Relational Well-Being. He is an AAMFT and MN State Approved MFT Supervisor and can be reached at <supervision@irwb.org>

    For clients of FMT, this means that a seasoned, fully-licensed therapist is working collaboratively with me (behind the scenes) to oversee and ensure that the highest level of quality and client care are being provided.

    You get an extra set of ears on the progress of our work together (#twoforone), and I get the opportunity to have ongoing professional guidance and input as I continue to work toward licensure.
