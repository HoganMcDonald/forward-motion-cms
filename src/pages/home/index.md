  title: What Therapy Looks Like
  content: |-
    Therapy at FMT is focused on helping individuals & couples gain movement from the cyclical ruts we often find ourselves in. Relationships are at the core of our human experience and issues within those relationships are unavoidable (despite our best efforts!) 

    In therapy, we will explore the underlying process that continues to play out in ways that aren't helping anymore... they're now hindering. Together, we work to acknowledge, heal, and honor who you are, where you've been, and where you want to be heading. This is achieved first and foremost with your willingness to look deeper and explore; to take the time to delve into what lies below the surface. There's also a decent amount  psycho-education, homework (if desired & applicable), and exploring your family of origin.

    In a nutshell, the goal is to become more aware of who you are, what you and your relationships need, and what inner strengths you already have that can be utilized to work for you & your goals.

    I believe life is about who you are in relationship, whether that relationship is with yourself, a partner, co-worker, boss, friend, pet… whoever. How you react, how you communicate, what level of awareness you have of yourself; your reactions, triggers, attachments, communication styles, etc. - they all matter! And… they all directly affect every single one of our relationships.

    Unfortunately, we’re not explicitly taught & socialized how to exist, grow, or thrive in relationships. Therapy is an ideal place to learn, grow, and create the space in your life and relationships that can foster forward motion from patterns you’re cycling in.

    I received my MA in Marriage and Family Therapy from St. Mary’s University of MN, and my BS in Community Psychology from St Cloud State University.

    I am working toward Licensure and all therapeutic services I provide are under the supervision of Shawn R Neel, MS, LMFT with The Institute for Relational Well-Being. He is an AAMFT and MN State Approved MFT Supervisor and can be reached at <supervision@irwb.org>

    For clients of FMT, this means that a seasoned, fully-licensed therapist is working collaboratively with me (behind the scenes) to oversee and ensure that the highest level of quality and client care are being provided.

    You get an extra set of ears on the progress of our work together (#twoforone), and I get the opportunity to have ongoing professional guidance and input as I continue to work toward licensure.
