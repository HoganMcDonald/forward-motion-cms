    Whether in office or tele-therapy, our work focuses on relationship-ing. On
    helping individuals & couples gain movement from the cyclical ruts we often
    find ourselves in... with ourselves, with others, with all the things.
    Relationships are at the core of our human experience and issues within
    those relationships are unavoidable - despite our best efforts! 


    In therapy, we explore the underlying process that plays out in ways that
    aren't helping anymore... now they hinder. Together, we work to acknowledge,
    heal, and honor who you are, where you've been, and where you want to be
    heading. This is achieved first and foremost with your willingness to look
    deeper and explore; to take the time to be curious with what's below the
    surface for you. There's also a decent amount  psycho-education, homework
    (if desired & applicable), and exploring your family of origin.


    End of the day, the goal is to become more aware of who you are, what you
    need, what your relationships need, and how you can tap into all that you
    already have so it can work for you. Smarter, not harder.

    Life is filled with relationships. Relationship-ing happens with yourself,
    your partner(s), co-workers, family, friends, pets… whoever and whatever.
    How you react, how you communicate, what level of awareness you have of
    yourself; your perceptions, reactions, attachments, communication styles,
    etc. - they all matter! And… they all directly affect the experiences we
    have.


    Unfortunately, we’re not explicitly taught & socialized how to exist, grow,
    or thrive in relationships. Therapy is an ideal place to learn, grow, and
    create the space in your life and relationships to foster forward motion
    from the current cycles.


    I received my MA in Marriage and Family Therapy from St. Mary’s University
    of MN, and my BS in Community Psychology, with a minor in Applied Behavior
    Analysis, from St. Cloud State University. Additionally, I'm trained in both
    EMDR (EMDRIA approved training course) and hold a Gottman Method Couples
    Therapy Level 1 Certificate.


    I am working toward Licensure and all therapeutic services I provide are
    under the supervision of Margaret Houston, DMFT, LMFT. She is a MN State
    Approved MFT Supervisor and can be reached at (612) 875-0668.


    For clients this means a seasoned, fully-licensed therapist is working
    collaboratively with me (behind the scenes) to oversee and ensure that the
    highest level of quality and client care are being provided.


    You get an extra set of ears on the progress of our work together. I get the
    opportunity to have ongoing professional guidance and input while I work
    toward full licensure.

    So, here's the thing... therapy is like most things in life. The connection
    and fit matter. AND... These things are subjective; what's 'good' for one,
    very well could be a shit show for another.


    It's important when deciding to work with a therapist (any therapist) that
    you know the following:


    1. Therapists are a dime a dozen. It's worth your time & effort to find a
    therapist you and yours are comfortable with.

    2. Therapy is a process. What has taken decades to create, will not change
    overnight. Being comfortable with your chosen therapist is vital - because
    uncomfortable things will inevitably come up. The last thing anyone needs is
    to be working through their baggage with someone who doesn't feel safe to
    them walking along side.


    What I can offer you (spoiler alert: it's not all the answers!!), is a space
    filled with genuine care and concern for you as a human. I share my insight
    and knowledge that is rooted in Family Systems Theory, and provide you the
    opportunity to gain insight about yourself and your relationships in a safe
    space. Cheers to the #judgefreezone!
