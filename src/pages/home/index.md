    Whether in office or tele-therapy, our work focuses on
    **_'relationshiping.'_** Helping individuals & partners gain movement from
    the cyclical ruts we often find ourselves in... with ourselves, with others,
    with all the things. Relationships are at the core of our human experience
    and issues within those relationships are unavoidable - despite our best
    efforts! 


    In therapy, we explore the underlying process that plays out in ways that
    aren't helping anymore... now they hinder. Together, we work to acknowledge,
    heal, and honor who you are, where you've been, and where you want to be
    heading. This is achieved first and foremost with your willingness to look
    deeper and explore; to take the time to be curious with what's below the
    surface for you. There's also a decent amount  psycho-education, homework
    (if desired & applicable), and exploring your family of origin.


    End of day, the goal is to become more aware of who you are, what you need,
    what your relationships need, and how you can tap into what you already have
    so it can work for you. Smarter, not harder.

    Life is filled with relationships. **'_Relationshiping' _**happens with
    yourself, your partner(s), co-workers, family, friends, pets… whoever and
    whatever. How you react, how you communicate, what level of awareness you
    have of yourself and others; perceptions, reactions, attachments,
    communication styles, etc. - they all play a role. Whether we like it or
    not, they all directly affect the lived experience.


    Unfortunately, we’re not explicitly taught & socialized how to exist, grow,
    or thrive in relationships. Therapy is an ideal place to learn, grow, and
    create the space in your life and relationships to foster forward motion
    from the current cycles.


    I completed my MA in Marriage and Family Therapy at St. Mary’s University of
    MN, and my BS in Community Psychology, with a minor in Applied Behavior
    Analysis, at St. Cloud State University. I currently hold MN License #4526;
    Licensed Associate Marriage and Family Therapist. Additionally, I'm trained
    in EMDR (EMDRIA approved training course) and Gottman Method Couples Therapy
    (Level 1 Certificate).


    I am working toward Licensure and all therapeutic services I provide are
    under the supervision of Margaret Houston, DMFT, LMFT. She is a MN State
    Approved MFT Supervisor and can be reached at (612) 875-0668.


    For clients this means a seasoned, fully-licensed therapist is working
    collaboratively with me (behind the scenes) to oversee and ensure that the
    highest level of quality and client care are being provided.


    You get an extra set of ears on the progress of our work together. I get
    ongoing professional guidance and input as I work toward full licensure.

    So, here's the thing - therapy is like everything else in life, not one size
    fits all. The connection and fit matter. AND... These things are subjective;
    what's 'good' for one, very well could be a hot mess for another.


    It's important when deciding to work with a therapist that you know the
    following:


    1. **Therapists are a dime a dozen.** It's worth your time & effort to find
    a therapist you and yours are comfortable with.

    2. **Therapy is a process.** What has taken decades to create, will not
    change overnight. Being comfortable with your chosen therapist is vital -
    because uncomfortable things will inevitably come up. The last thing anyone
    needs is to be working through their baggage with someone who comes off as
    an a-hole walking along side.


    What I can offer you is space filled with genuine care and concern for you
    as a human and some support to help you meet your goals. I share my insight
    and knowledge that is rooted in Family Systems Theory, and provide you the
    opportunity to gain insight about yourself and your relationships in a safe
    space. Cheers to the #judgefreezone!


    More questions? Don't hesitate to reach out - I'm happy to schedule a
    complementary 15 minute telehealth or phone consultation.
