    Therapy at FMT focuses on relationships.  on helping individuals & couples
    gain movement from the cyclical ruts we often find ourselves in.
    Relationships are at the core of our human experience and issues within
    those relationships are unavoidable (despite our best efforts!) 


    In therapy, we will explore the underlying process that continues to play
    out in ways that aren't helping anymore... they're now hindering. Together,
    we work to acknowledge, heal, and honor who you are, where you've been, and
    where you want to be heading. This is achieved first and foremost with your
    willingness to look deeper and explore; to take the time to delve into what
    lies below the surface. There's also a decent amount  psycho-education,
    homework (if desired & applicable), and exploring your family of origin.


    In a nutshell, the goal is to become more aware of who you are, what you and
    your relationships need, and what inner strengths you already have that can
    be utilized to work for you & your goals.

    I believe life is about who you are in relationship, whether that
    relationship is with yourself, a partner, co-worker, boss, friend, pet…
    whoever. How you react, how you communicate, what level of awareness you
    have of yourself; your reactions, triggers, attachments, communication
    styles, etc. - they all matter! And… they all directly affect every single
    one of our relationships.


    Unfortunately, we’re not explicitly taught & socialized how to exist, grow,
    or thrive in relationships. Therapy is an ideal place to learn, grow, and
    create the space in your life and relationships that can foster forward
    motion from patterns you’re cycling in.


    I received my MA in Marriage and Family Therapy from St. Mary’s University
    of MN, and my BS in Community Psychology from St Cloud State University.


    I am working toward Licensure and all therapeutic services I provide are
    under the supervision of Shawn R Neel, MS, LMFT with The Institute for
    Relational Well-Being. He is an AAMFT and MN State Approved MFT Supervisor
    and can be reached at <supervision@irwb.org>


    For clients of FMT, this means that a seasoned, fully-licensed therapist is
    working collaboratively with me (behind the scenes) to oversee and ensure
    that the highest level of quality and client care are being provided.


    You get an extra set of ears on the progress of our work together
    (#twoforone), and I get the opportunity to have ongoing professional
    guidance and input as I continue to work toward licensure.

    So, here's the thing... with therapy, just like most things in life,
    connection and a good fit matter. AND... These things are subjective; what's
    'good' for one person/couple/family, very well may not be 'good' for
    another.


    It's important when deciding to work with a therapist (any therapist) that
    you know the following:


    1. Therapists are a dime a dozen. It's worth your time & effort to find a
    therapist you and yours are comfortable with.


    2. Therapy is a process. What has taken decades to create, will not change
    overnight. Being comfortable with your chosen therapist is vital - because
    uncomfortable things will inevitably come up. The last thing anyone needs is
    to be working through their baggage in the presence of someone who doesn't
    feel safe to them. 


    What I can offer you (spoiler alert: it's not all the answers!!), is a space
    filled with genuine care and concern for you as a human. I'll share my
    insight and knowledge that is rooted in Family Systems Theory, and provide
    you the opportunity to gain insight about yourself and your relationships in
    a safe space. Cheers to the #judgefreezone!
